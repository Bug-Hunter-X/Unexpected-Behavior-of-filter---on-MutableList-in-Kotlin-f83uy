This repository demonstrates a common misunderstanding in Kotlin regarding the `filter()` function and its interaction with mutable lists.  The `filter()` function in Kotlin, when applied to a list (mutable or immutable), *always* returns a *new* list containing only the elements that satisfy the given predicate. The original list remains unchanged.  This example highlights this behavior and offers a solution for modifying a mutable list in place.
